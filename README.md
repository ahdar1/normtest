# normtest
This is an SPSS file in spd format. 
Normtest.spd is the spd versions of the original DeCarlo's sps syntax to perform multivariate normality tests. The Mardia.spd does not give an omnibus test of normality for each variable tested.Normtest.spd gives the plot of ordered squared Mahalanobis distances for detecting the presence of multivariate normal (in which case the points lie along diagonal) and multivariate outliers. The macro reports 10 cases (5 in the original code) with the largest squared Mahalanobis distances.
When installed on SPSS, the macros can be found under the menu Analyze-->Descriptive Statistics
